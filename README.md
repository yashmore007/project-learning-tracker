# 🧠 Learning Tracker

- A web app to track my daily learning progress across topics like React, Data Structures, TypeScript, and more — with streaks, stats, and notes.

# 🚀 What Problem I'm Solving

- I often struggled to stay consistent while learning.
- This app helps me track what I learn each day, stay accountable, and visualize progress with streaks and stats.

# 👤 Who This Is For

- Initially built for myself — to develop consistency and build in public.
- Later, it could help other devs who also struggle to stay consistent while learning.

## 🎯 MVP Goal

- Users can log a learning session (topic, duration, and notes)

- Track streaks and total learning hours

- View stats and insights from past sessions

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)

- TypeScript

- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

- MongoDB Atlas

- Auth.js (Google Login)
