# What problem I'm solving

- I want to track my daily learning progress across topics like React, DS, TypeScript etc. with streaks, stats, and notes.

# Who this is for

- Initially, for me. Later, maybe for other devs who struggle with consistency.

# my goal for MVP

- User can log a learning session, see their streak, and view stats like total hours learned.
