## 📅 Day 12-42 – Dec 17, 2025

✅ Summary: Focused on understanding my codebase deeply and implemented secure, user-scoped data access with Prisma + MongoDB.

### 🧠 What I Learned (Tech)

During this period, I intentionally slowed down and studied my project to understand how it works under the hood.

- Gained a clear understanding of how Auth.js v5 handles authentication, sessions, and user data flow.

- Learned how Zustand manages global state and how it fits into my app architecture.

- Understood how Prisma works with MongoDB Atlas, including models, relations, and queries.

#### Still unclear / needs learning:

- I need to do a deeper dive into Prisma schema design and advanced modeling patterns.

### 🚀 What I Built / Shipped

- ✅ Implemented user-scoped data access so each user can only access data associated with their Google or GitHub account.

- ✅ Added the ability for users to log what they studied and view those logs in a Today’s Progress section.

### 🐞 Problem I Faced & How I Solved It

- I initially struggled to fix some bugs, which pushed me to deeply understand the project architecture instead of applying surface-level fixes.

- Faced multiple Vercel deployment failures, mostly caused by missing or incorrect TypeScript types.

- Researched through documentation and GitHub issues, fixed the type errors, and successfully deployed the app.

- Key insight:
  - Most production issues were not logic errors, but type and data-flow mistakes, reinforcing the importance of strict typing and understanding data ownership.

### 🔥 Tomorrow’s Focus

- Build a GitHub-style heatmap so users can visually track their consistency.
