## 📅 Day 43-46 – Dec 21, 2025

- ✅ Implemented streak tracking feature using GitHub-style heatmap visualization

### 🧠 What I Learned (Tech)

- Gained deeper understanding of TypeScript type systems and type safety
- Learned to effectively manipulate and work with arrays of objects
- Successfully integrated and configured React Calendar Heatmap library

#### Still unclear / needs learning:

- Developing stronger algorithmic thinking and problem-solving logic

### 🚀 What I Built / Shipped

- ✅ Implemented GitHub-style heatmap for visualizing learning streaks using React Calendar Heatmap library

🔗 **Commit:** [docs: update journal for day-43-56](https://github.com/yashmore007/project-learning-tracker/commit/6128ae6bbac461744c04dd2186dac1722dce90cd)

### 🐞 Problem I Faced & How I Solved It

- Encountered TypeScript type compatibility issues when passing data to the heatmap component
- Resolved by researching TypeScript documentation and leveraging AI-assisted debugging to properly type the data structures

- Initially uncertain about proper usage of JavaScript's Date constructor for heatmap data format
- Studied MDN documentation and successfully implemented correct date formatting logic

### 🔥 Tomorrow's Focus

- Begin implementation of "What's Next to Study" recommendation section
- Design logic for suggesting learning topics based on user progress
