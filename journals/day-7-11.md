### 🐞 Problem I Faced & How I Solved It

- Struggled with some basic Next.js concepts.

- So I stopped, went back to fundamentals, and understood them properly.

- Realized going “too deep” can trap me forever — so now I’m focusing on learning what’s needed right now, instead of exploring endlessly.

### 🎯 Next Focus (Tomorrow)

- Add logic to the dashboard.
